Nothing special during Week 37 (not really into computers right now… a lot of bouldering and photography instead, which is nice too!).

## Cron - Mysql

Mysql has a native [event system](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/create-event.html) which can be quite useful if you want to update something on your database without using some cron and backend logic. You will have to use the [pg_cron](https://github.com/citusdata/pg_cron) extension if you want the same behavior on Postgres. Thanks [Olivier](https://devblog.dunsap.com/) for this discovery!

## PHP - Migrations

Most web frameworks have their own migration tool (Laravel, Symfony, Django…). [Phinx](https://phinx.org/) is a PHP framework agnostic migration tool. Looks quite interesting and can be useful if you are working on an old project with no framework.

## Python - Equality

Python supports multiple equality comparison whereas PHP doesn't.

Python:

```python
1.0 == 1 == 1.00 # True
```

PHP

```php
# Parse error:  syntax error, unexpected token "==" in php shell code on line 1
1.0 == 1 == 1.00;
```

As a dev, you use docker as a dev environment. You’re quite happy that you finally ended mastering it (or at least make it work \\o/). Since you’re a great developer, you know the importance of automated testing, and you wrote a bunch of specs or features to test. You made everything work locally thanks to a few docker-compose commands. Maybe you’re thinking now that it could be awesome to even automate the process of launching those tests, by delegating this process to a CI, that will listen to your Github events, and send you back a green or red dot on your Pull Request’s page.

Since you used CircleCI a few years ago, since they claim it’s easy to use with docker and since they provide a free plan, you think you’re gonna make it standing on your head. Well, let me tell you that it can be quite a pain in the a\*\* if you don’t have the right instructions, and the documentation is quite awful when it comes to using it with docker-compose. Fortunately, it can be very easy when you get the right options to use in the config.

# Let’s dive into it!

After having created your CircleCI account and connected it to your repository, you will have a sample config file given by CircleCI. It may look like this (hum…):

Well, that’s quite intimidating. At least there is the \`docker\` keyword, so you think you’re going in the right direction. Let me tell me you’re wrong.

Actually, this \`docker\` keyword means your CircleCI build will be launched in a docker container instead of a Linux VM. After reading the whole documentation, you realize that you have to use a Linux VM to be able to use docker-compose with volumes (link: [https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/executor-types/](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/executor-types/) ).

So let’s create a new config file, step by step.

So we have a very basic install. Nice. Let’s add a checkout of the repository.

Docker-compose is by default installed on the Linux VM provided by CircleCI. We can directly build and up our containers.

Now you can install the dependencies of your project. Here we have node (yarn) and PHP (composer) dependencies.

Now we can run our tests!

Tada! An extra bonus? Let’s say you do some End2End testing and you take some screenshots when a test failed… Maybe you want to be able to access the screenshot (or log file) from the CircleCI interface? You can add a directory as an \`artifact\`. This will be then available in the \`artifacts\` link above your tests.

So cool! Now you have a CI running with docker-compose, using your dev environment. Pretty swag.  
Now, some of you may encounter permissions problems because of the users. This can be because CircleCI uses a user with id \`1001\` and a group with id \`1002\`. Sometimes in can conflict with your local permissions (your local user being \`1000\` in general). If so, you can specify the user that will launch the docker command.

I hope this article helped you to make this small green dot appear on your PRs :).

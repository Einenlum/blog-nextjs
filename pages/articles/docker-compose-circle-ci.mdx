As a dev, you use docker as a dev environment. You’re quite happy that you finally ended mastering it (or at least make it work \\o/). Since you’re a great developer, you know the importance of automated testing, and you wrote a bunch of specs or features to test. You made everything work locally thanks to a few docker-compose commands. Maybe you’re thinking now that it could be awesome to even automate the process of launching those tests, by delegating this process to a CI, that will listen to your Github events, and send you back a green or red dot on your Pull Request’s page.

Since you used CircleCI a few years ago, since they claim it’s easy to use with docker and since they provide a free plan, you think you’re gonna make it standing on your head. Well, let me tell you that it can be quite a pain in the a\*\* if you don’t have the right instructions, and the documentation is quite awful when it comes to using it with docker-compose. Fortunately, it can be very easy when you get the right options to use in the config.

# Let’s dive into it!

After having created your CircleCI account and connected it to your repository, you will have a sample config file given by CircleCI. It may look like this (hum…):

```yaml
version: 2
jobs:
    build:
        working_directory: ~/mern-starter
        # The primary container is an instance of the first image listed. The job's commands run in this container.
        docker:
            - image: circleci/node:4.8.2-jessie
            # The secondary container is an instance of the second listed image which is run in a common network where ports exposed on the primary container are available on localhost.
            - image: mongo:3.4.4-jessie
        steps:
            - checkout
            - run:
                  name: Update npm
                  command: 'sudo npm install -g npm@latest'
            - restore_cache:
                  key: dependency-cache-{{ checksum "package.json" }}
            - run:
                  name: Install npm wee
                  command: npm install
            - save_cache:
                  key: dependency-cache-{{ checksum "package.json" }}
                  paths:
                      - node_modules
    test:
        docker:
            - image: circleci/node:4.8.2-jessie
            - image: mongo:3.4.4-jessie
        steps:
            - checkout
            - run:
                  name: Test
                  command: npm test
            - run:
                  name: Generate code coverage
                  command: './node_modules/.bin/nyc report --reporter=text-lcov'
            - store_artifacts:
                  path: test-results.xml
                  prefix: tests
            - store_artifacts:
                  path: coverage
                  prefix: coverage

workflows:
    version: 2
    build_and_test:
        jobs:
            - build
            - test:
                  requires:
                      - build
                  filters:
                      branches:
                          only: master
```

Well, that’s quite intimidating. At least there is the \`docker\` keyword, so you think you’re going in the right direction. Let me tell me you’re wrong.

Actually, this \`docker\` keyword means your CircleCI build will be launched in a docker container instead of a Linux VM. After reading the whole documentation, you realize that you have to use a Linux VM to be able to use docker-compose with volumes (link: [https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/executor-types/](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/executor-types/) ).

So let’s create a new config file, step by step.

```yaml
version: 2 # CircleCI version
jobs:
    build:
        machine: true # Use a Linux VM instead of docker environment
        working_directory: ~/repo # Default working directory, where your project will be cloned
```

So we have a very basic install. Nice. Let’s add a checkout of the repository.

```yaml
build:
    # ..
    steps:
        - checkout
        # Maybe you need to add some config file specific to circle…
        - run: cp .circleci/.some-parameter-file .some-parameter-file
```

Docker-compose is by default installed on the Linux VM provided by CircleCI. We can directly build and up our containers.

```yaml
build:
    # ..
    steps:
        # - …
        - run: docker-compose up -d
```

Now you can install the dependencies of your project. Here we have node (yarn) and PHP (composer) dependencies.

```yaml
steps:
    # - …
    - run: docker-compose exec php composer install -n --prefer-dist
    - run: docker-compose run --rm front yarn install
    - run: docker-compose run --rm front yarn build
```

Now we can run our tests!

```yaml
steps:
    # - …
    - run: docker-compose exec php vendor/bin/phpspec run -vvv
    - run: docker-compose exec php ./vendor/bin/behat -v
```

Tada! An extra bonus? Let’s say you do some End2End testing and you take some screenshots when a test failed… Maybe you want to be able to access the screenshot (or log file) from the CircleCI interface? You can add a directory as an \`artifact\`. This will be then available in the \`artifacts\` link above your tests.

```yaml
steps:
    # …

    # This line is to be able to access failing screenshots in the
    # artifacts section in CircleCI
    - store_artifacts:
          path: ~/repo/features/fail-screenshots
```

So cool! Now you have a CI running with docker-compose, using your dev environment. Pretty swag.  
Now, some of you may encounter permissions problems because of the users. This can be because CircleCI uses a user with id \`1001\` and a group with id \`1002\`. Sometimes in can conflict with your local permissions (your local user being \`1000\` in general). If so, you can specify the user that will launch the docker command.

```yaml
steps:
    # run tests!

    # Circleci uses a user with id 1001 and a group with id 1002
    # We use this user instead of the default one in our dockerfile (1000)
    # to avoid permissions issues
    - run: docker-compose exec --user=1001:1002 php vendor/bin/phpspec run -vvv

    # We use the root user here to change logs and cache permissions
    - run: docker-compose exec --user=root php chmod -R 777 var/logs
    - run: docker-compose exec --user=root php chmod -R 777 var/cache
```

I hope this article helped you to make this small green dot appear on your PRs :).

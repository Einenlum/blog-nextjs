## Cat

I had always used `cat` to print the content of a file. I just learned that `cat` is for `conCATenate`. It allows to print the content of multiple files and to possibly pipe it to another file / process.

```
cat file1 file2 file3
```

will print the content of each file in order, concatenated.

## PHP

PHP has `endif`, `endwhile`, `endfor`, `endforeach` and `endswitch` statements.

Can be useful if you are mixing PHP and HTML (which you absolutely shouldn't of course):

```php
<?php if ($a == 5): ?>
A is equal to 5
<?php endif; ?>
```

And with `if`:

```php

<?php
if ($a == 5):
    echo "a equals 5";
    echo "...";
elseif ($a == 6):
    echo "a equals 6";
    echo "!!!";
else:
    echo "a is neither 5 nor 6";
endif;
?>
```

Reminds a bit of ruby with its `if ... end`. Funny.

Examples taken from [official documentation](https://www.php.net/manual/en/control-structures.alternative-syntax.php). I worked with PHP for years and had never encountered this syntax. I's probably a good sign ;).

## Git

This [git plugin](https://github.com/PotatoLabs/git-redate) (`git-redate`) allows to easily change the datetime of some past commits.

## Vim - Neovim - Lua

You can have a `lua` folder in your `~/.config/nvim` folder which will make these scripts discoverable.

Then you can have multiple levels of files:

```
├── init.vim
├── lua
│   ├── einenlum
│   │   ├── init.lua
```

Everything in `lua/einenlum/init.lua` will automatically be loaded when requiring `einenlum` in my `init.vim` file (VimL script):

```VimL
lua require('einenlum')
```

This is kind of equivalent to what Python has with packages and `__init__.py` files.

You can check a bit more how it works in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/Einenlum/dotfiles-manjaro/blob/2873c3acc956a00452d7056c26f341c0d17d8eff/nvim/init.vim#L12).

## Vim - Neovim

I have used vim for many years now but I didn't know `_` (underscore) leads to the "real" beginning of the line (compared to `0`).

## Laravel - Mocking time in tests

In Laravel, if you want to change the current time, you can use `$this->travelTo`.
It accepts `Carbon` and `DateTimeInterface` objects, closures are strings.

```php
$this->travelTo('2022-11-06');
$this->travelTo(\DateTimeImmutable::createFromFormat('Y-m-d', '2022-11-06'));
```

## Laravel - Blade - Components

Blade, Laravel's templating engine, allows to natively create [components](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/blade#components). Every template in `resources/views/components` (ex: `my-card.blade.php`) can then be called in another template (ex: `<x-my-card></x-mx-card>`).

You can pass children components that will be accessible through `{{ $slots }}` (equivalent to React's `{{ children }}`).

Twig also has [components](https://symfony.com/bundles/ux-twig-component/current/index.html).

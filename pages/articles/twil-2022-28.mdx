## Postgres

- Thanks to [this article](https://blog.rustprooflabs.com/2022/07/postgres-15-unique-improvement-with-null) I learned that Postgres (and major other SQL DBs) treat `null` values as distinct when adding a **Unique constraint**.
- Postgres doesn't support **ULID** natively yet. There are [some experimental extensions](https://github.com/iCyberon/pg_ulid) to do so, but not official ones. More details [here](https://blog.daveallie.com/ulid-primary-keys).

## PDF Generation

- If you don't manage to do what you want when generating a PDF with *puppeteer* or *wkhtmltopdf*, and don't want to buy a super expensive license of [Prince](https://www.princexml.com/purchase/), you can try to generate it through the SASS service [DocRaptor](https://docraptor.com/). The tests (with a big watermark) are free unlimited, but a free acount gives you 5 documents generated for free without watemark. Great service and customer service, and the premium version is not so expensive if you don't need to generate documents on a daily basis.

## PHP

- This PHP library, [T-Regx](https://t-regx.com/) wraps native PHP regex functions in a nice API, close to what you could get with Python. Interesting.

## CSS/Tailwind

- In CSS, utility classes are really not the same as inline styles. I read this very interesting [article](https://frontstuff.io/no-utility-classes-arent-the-same-as-inline-styles) defending utility classes (tools like [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)). Tailwind always sounded super weird and counter-intuitive to me (without even trying). This makes me want to try it.

## React / Markdown

- You can use Markdown in your JSX files through [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/).

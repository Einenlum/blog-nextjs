Dear potential employers,

I know your company is dealing with urgent issues. I know the market is quite rough at the moment. I know good developers have now high and diverse expectations: keeping track of these must not be easy.

It seems like for some of you, free coffee or free candies are a must have. Available Nerf guns in the office are maybe the line in your job offer that will make your company stand out from the others.

Maybe you’re right. Maybe I totally underestimate this kind of features. But one thing that matters to me and that you **often forget, is the technical stack** you want me to deal with.

I’m not kidding. **Some offers don’t even mention one programming language**. You could think it’s an exception and that I chose only small and dubious companies. You would be wrong.

Here is a [job offer](https://boards.greenhouse.io/reddit/jobs/655395?t=onmjps1#.WlRYj_ZG2Hs) to work at Reddit.

It seems all they want is _clean, maintainable, and well-tested code_. You should know what it means, you, little _Backend_ developer. Does it include Node? Python? Ruby? Rust? PHP? Go? No one will know. I hope you are working to be familiar _with the whole web stack_.  
Consider the list of all the things we know about this offer.

*   Pet Care Stipend
*   Monthly Cell Phone Allowance
*   Catered Meals & Snacks

It’s great to know this. But I have the feeling that the authors got lost along the way. Please, next time, try not to forget to mention a few more details about the work I will be doing for you. Write it down even at the very top of your job offer. It will save time to anyone.

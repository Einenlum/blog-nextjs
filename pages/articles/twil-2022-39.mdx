## Swagger Editor

Swagger Editor sadly [does not support OpenApi 3.1](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/issues/2638) until now (although it was released in February 2021).

## Swagger - Code Generation

Swagger supports [server code generation in many languages](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/).
Yes, I was today years old when I found out about it.

Another forked project is [OpenApi Generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator).

Sadly, both seem quite complicated to me (and Django is not supported).

## Python - Assert

The second parameter to assert in Python, is the message to throw in the `AssertionError`.

```python
a = 3
assert a < 0, "Sorry, a can't be greater than 0"
```

## Python - Instructions

Python is really more flexible than other languages and it reads code line by line.

This is a perfectly valid piece of code (which for a PHP or Java developer is super weird):

```python
class Foo:
    for i in range(10):
        # We create on the fly 10 methods from
        # fun_0 .. to fun_9
        locals()[f'fun_{i}'] = lambda self, x: x

obj = Foo()

obj.fun_3('hello') # 'hello'
```

## Git - new commands

I just realized git has a `switch` command since some time (thanks [Olivier](https://devblog.dunsap.com/) for the discovery!).

`git switch branchName` is equivalent to `git checkout branchName`.

`git switch -c branchName` is equivalent to `git checkout -b branchName`.

Als found out about: `git whatchanged --since="2 weeks ago"`. This is really cool.

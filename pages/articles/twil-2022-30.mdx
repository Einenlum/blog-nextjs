I'm in holidays so I allow myself to skip a week of learning (sorry week 29!) ^^.

## Python - Bytecode - Threads

There was a [subtle change](https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/4958f5d69dd2bf86866c43491caf72f774ddec97) in how Python 3.10 produces bytecode. This can lead to [normal behaviors when expect strange ones](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69993959/python-threads-difference-for-3-10-and-others) (yes, this sentence is fucked up). I was trying to reproduce a common Python problem with threads and race conditions and I couldn't.

Before 3.10, this code was leading to an unexpected result, different from `1000000`:

```python
import threading


a = 0
threads = []


def x():
    global a
    for i in range(1_000_000):
        a += 1


for _ in range(10):
    thread = threading.Thread(target=x)
    threads.append(thread)
    thread.start()


for thread in threads:
    thread.join()


print(a) # The number was off here
```

Starting from 3.10, it does print 1000000.

Replacing `a += 1` with `a += int(1)` brings back the unexpected behavior.

## Python - async

The `async/await` syntax is independent from the `asyncio` module. Actually you can use different event loop than `asyncio` like [uvloop](https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop) (which seems faster). (Thanks to my friend [Olivier](https://devblog.dunsap.com/) for the explanation!)

## SQLite

SQLite keeps a journal to keep the integrity of the database which makes it much slower. You can tweak this behavior if you think it's not worth it (like on your local machine for development). You can learn more about it on [Olivier's blog](https://devblog.dunsap.com/2022/07-28---making-sqlite-much-faster-in-a-local-dev-environment/#inserting-data-in-a-sqlite-database-can-be-quite-slow).

## Databases

[EdgeDB](https://www.edgedb.com/) is a database working with PostgreSQL under the hood. It allows you to work with objects instead of tables directly in the database. You can then use EdgeQL (instead of SQL) to query it. It also handles migrations and pretends to overcome the use of ORMs. Honestly, it sounds promising. I'm just a bit skeptical about the tooling and clients so far. The [Python client](https://github.com/edgedb/edgedb-python) looks quite rudimentary (no official client for PHP yet) and I wonder you map the database objects to your models and how you easily update an existing one. Anyway, I'll keep an eye on this. (Thanks again to Olivier for this discovery!)

## PHP

The `range` function not only accepts integers but also floats and strings.

```php
/*
[
    "a",
    "b",
    ...
    "y",
    "z",
   ]
*/
range('a', 'z');

/*
[
    "A",
    "B",
    ...
    "Y",
    "Z",
]
*/
range('A', 'Z');
```

This can be quite useful. On the other hand, `range('a', 'Z')` doesn't work as expected.

```php
/*
[
    "a",
    "`",
    "_",
    "^",
    "]",
    "\",
    "[",
    "Z",
] ?
*/
range('a', 'Z');
```

To get the full a-Z range, use `array_merge` (and not `+` since `+` is not case sensitive).

```php
/*
[
    "a",
    "b",
    ...
    "y",
    "z",
   ]
*/
range('a', 'z') + range('A', 'Z'); // The first array is not overriden

/*
[
    "a",
    "b",
    ...
    "Y",
    "Z",
   ]
*/
array_merge(range('a', 'z'), range('A', 'Z'));
```

This can be quite useful. But still less elegant than the Python counterparts.

PHP:

```php
// "ab...yz"
implode('', range('a', 'z'));

// "ab...YZ"
implode('', range('A', 'Z'));

// "ab...YZ"
implode('', array_merge(range('a', 'z'), range('A', 'Z')));
```

Python:

```python
import string

string.ascii_lowercase # 'ab...yz'

string.ascii_uppercase # 'AB...YZ'

string.ascii_letters # 'ab...YZ'
```

If you want to generate a range of floats, use the third argument to determine the step.

```php
/*
[
    0.0,
    0.1,
    ...
    1.9,
    2.0,
   ]
*/
range(0.0, 2.0, 0.1);
```

## PHP

There is no native range iterator in PHP (as the native Python `range` function in 3.x and the `xrange` function in 2.x). Seems like you have to build your own.

Weird that it's still not in the standard lib.

```php
function xrange($start, $end, $step = 1) {
    for ($i = $start; $i <= $end; $i += $step) {
        yield $i;
    }
}

foreach (xrange(0, 1000000) as $x) {
}
```

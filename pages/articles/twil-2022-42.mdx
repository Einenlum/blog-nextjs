## Rust - Order of execution

It seems like in Rust, the order of execution is sometimes unusual.

Consider this piece of code:

```rust
let guess: u32 = "42".parse().expect("Not a number!");
```

Let's omit the `expect` method (which is really interesting) here.

If we don't use the type annotation (`u32`), there is a compiler error because Rust doesn't know how to parse the string:

```rust
// Won't compile
let guess = "42".parse().expect("Not a number!");
```

In other languages you might expect something like a parameter of the `parse` function to indicate the target type:

```rust
let guess = "42".parse(u32).expect("Not a number!");
```

Here, the type annotation which is on the **left** side of the evaluation, changes what happens on the right part of the line. It's very unusual and confusing to me.

## fzf - Git

[fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) has a multi select line when adding the `-m` option. Then you can use `Tab` to select multiple entries.

If you add this into your `.gitconfig` file, you can then use `git fd` to delete multiple branches at once by selecting them. So lovely.

```
[alias]
    # Delete branches from your recent used ones
    fd = "!f() { git branch -a --sort=-committerdate | grep -v remotes\\/ | fzf -m | sed 's/remotes\\/origin\\///' | xargs -o git br -D; }; f"
```

You can see it in action [here](https://asciinema.org/a/531520).

    I'm a PHP and Python developer. Mostly living in Paris. I love open source and human languages.

    You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/Einenlum), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Einenlum) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yann-rabiller/). AFK, my name is Yann Rabiller. Right now I'm mainly working as a freelancer for short missions. If you think we could work together, you can contact me [here](mailto:yann.rabiller@gmail.com).

    Currently writing a book about Python for PHP developers. Coming soon ðŸ™Š.

    ## My skills

    - **PHP**: Mostly working with **Symfony**, but I can also work with **Laravel**
    - **Python**: I can find my way around **Django**
    - Tools: **docker**, **git**, **vim**
    - Databases: **Mysql**, **postgres**
    - Practices: DDD, BDD, Hexagonal Architecture
    - Frontend: I can fix a few things with **ReactJS**, but I'm not an expert
    - Human languages: **French** (native), **English** (fluent), **German** (intermediate), **Italian** (intermediate), **Polish** (beginner)

    ## What I want to learn next

    - Having fun right now (who would have thought) with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). Would love to be more at ease with frontend and Javascript in general.
    - Would love to learn a more low-level language like Go or Rust.
    - WebAssembly tickles my curiosity.

    ## About this website

    It was happily built thanks to [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

    Some blog articles were written a long time ago on my *Medium* account. I want to host articles on my own now.

    I decided to post every week an article about what I learned. We'll see how it goes.

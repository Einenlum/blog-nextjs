## Sorting - PHP - Python

In Python, as well as in PHP, by default, sorting is done respecting ASCII order and not alphabetical order.

So in Python:

```python
my_list = ['z', 'A', 'a', 'Z']
my_list.sort()

my_list # ['A', 'Z', 'a', 'z']
```

And in PHP:

```php
$myList = ['z', 'A', 'a', 'Z'];
sort($mylist);

$myList; // ['A', 'Z', 'a', 'z']
```

Discovered this in [Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python](https://nostarch.com/beyond-basic-stuff-python) from Al Sweigart.

## Python - Multiple equality

In Python we can use `a == b == c`. It works. But we shouldn't use `a != b != c`.

Why?

Because `a == b == c` is actually transformed into `a == b and b == c`. Which in the case of equality works the same.
But with `a != b != c` it's transformed into `a != b and b != c`. Which is not the same.

Indeed, if `a` and `c` are the same, this is `True`: `'a' != 'b' != 'a'`. If we change the order, it's then `False`: `'a' != 'a' != 'b'`.

Found again in Al Sweigart's book.

## PHP - Terminal - Tailwind

[Termwind](https://github.com/nunomaduro/termwind) is a PHP library allowing to use [Tailwind CSS](tailwindcss.com/)' syntax to build TUI applications. Not tested yet, but looks interesting.

## Build you own thing

A Github repository called [build-your-own-x](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x) provides a list of technologies (bots, databases, dockerâ€¦) rebuilt from scratch in several languages. Quite an interesting list.

## Python

There was a [subtle change](https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/4958f5d69dd2bf86866c43491caf72f774ddec97) in how Python 3.10 produces bytecode. This can lead to [normal behaviors when expect strange ones](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69993959/python-threads-difference-for-3-10-and-others) (yes, this sentence is fucked up). I was trying to reproduce a common Python problem with threads and race conditions and I couldn't.

Before 3.10, this code was leading to an unexpected result, different from `1000000`:

```python
import threading


a = 0
threads = []


def x():
    global a
    for i in range(1_000_000):
        a += 1


for _ in range(10):
    thread = threading.Thread(target=x)
    threads.append(thread)
    thread.start()


for thread in threads:
    thread.join()


print(a) # The number was off here
```

Starting from 3.10, it does print 1000000. 

Replacing `a += 1` with `a += int(1)` brings back the unexpected behavior.
